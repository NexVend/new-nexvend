															<h2>About NexVend</h2>
															<span class="byline">How We Started</span>
														</header>
														<p>
															NexVend is like many fairy tales in Silicon Valley. Everything started with an unique web based auction system. Initially this system was just a school project by Hilary and Wilson to score some marks. Both of them worked at on the system sometimes at Wilson's room, sometimes are Hilary's apartment, sometimes even during lectures. When the project was submitted, both of them suddenly came up with an idea on turning this project into a startup. So both of them started to revamp the whole code and killing bugs but yet they realized they were still heavily lacking of knowledge in cloud computing and ways to handle the latency and balancing the load of CoinCod.
														</p>
														<p>
															Then came along an old friend, Deb. At that time Deb was already leading a team of engineers working on various front-end and back-end projects. Deb has the great deal of experience which what Hilary and Wilson is lacked off. Deb worked on review the flaws in the codes and send out red flags. Vincent at that time was a research assistant for Centre of Excellence in Semantics Technology and Augmented Reality in UNIMAS. After hearing what Hilary and Wilson is working on, Vincent immediately address his interest in joining the team to work on ergonomic designs for all NexVend products.

																<h3>Principles ...</h3>
															</header>
															<p>
																We believe that innovation is the key to success in this era of globalisation and information technology. Nowadays, different aspects of our daily lives are changing very rapidly with an exponential rate. Because of those rapid transformations, solutions for today's problems might not be suitable and correct for tomorrow's challenges. Therefore, every individual and every business must be adaptable to those changes and find new solutions with continuous innovation.
															</p>
															<p>
																Besides developing custom apps for customers, NexVend has lots of products scaling internally. Most of these products are fun to work on. Should you be curious what we do during our free time, don't be. We understand that different developers codes at their optimum form in different hour. Thus our developers has flexible working hours. Developers are always encourage to experiment on new technologies or build one as their hobby.
